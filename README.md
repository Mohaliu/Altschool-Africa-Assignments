# Altschool Africa Assignments

## Description
This repository contains my code assigments from altschool africa data science program I am running. So far we have been give 4 assignments. 3 of them are introduction to python based assignments, with questions from data structures to data types, to how to use conditional statements and control flow (for and while loops), to how to use functions. 
While the last assignment is a data wrangling based question on how to use pandas to wrangle data. Worked on a dataset that has information about different crimes reported in the city of chicago. The data contains 23 columns and 1000 rows.
